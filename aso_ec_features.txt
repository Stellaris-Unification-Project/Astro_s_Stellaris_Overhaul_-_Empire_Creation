Feature Summary:
* Vanilla Overwrites
	- Removed all prescripted empires.
* New Content
	- New Origins:
		# Amoeba Alveo: This civilization shares a special bond with the Space Amoebas that breed in its home system.
		# Eldest Sibling: This society has an old legend about splinter groups of the population who left the planet in search for other planets to colonize in nearby solar systems.
		# Enlightened: [Warning! Challenging Origin!] The natural development of this civilization was greatly accelerated by the interference of another party, who helped them become a spacefaring culture.
		# Living Planet: Convergent evolution has resulted in this planet slowly being entirely covered by a single Hive Mind organism.
		# Overlord: This civilization established early contact with its immediate alien neighbor. Gradually, over the span of a century, subjugated their hapless neighbor into a vassal state.
		# Presentient Cousins: Another species evolved on this civilization's homeworld. It appears they may be close to reaching sentience.
		# Rogue Planet: [Warning! Challenging Origin!] This civilization's homeworld is a starless rogue planet floating in the void of space. An abnormally hot core and constant vulcanism allow life to thrive on the planet surface.
		# Sins of the Past: Whether through accident, war, or another means, this civilization nuked their own planet. A small portion of their populace escaped to an orbital habitat before the planet became completely uninhabitable. Enough time has passed, now, that their homeworld is habitable, if only barely.
		# Tale of Two Planets: A choose-your-own-adventure origin (with random elements) involving another habitable planet in your home system.
		# Unilateral Trade Agreement: This civilization established early contact with its immediate alien neighbor. Gradually, over the span of a century, subjugated their hapless neighbor into a tributary.
		# Violent Uplift: This civilization was brought into the interstellar age by defending itself against a superior foe.
