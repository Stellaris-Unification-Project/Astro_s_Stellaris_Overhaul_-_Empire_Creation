 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_AMOEBA_ALVEO:0 "For aeons uncounted, we have looked up at the skies and wondered what those massive creatures were. As our technology advanced, we realized they were not gods, but that did not stop us from revering them.\n\nEven before we mastered spaceflight, a bond was formed between our species. We have coexisted peacefully in our solar system for generations, now.\n\nThrough our observations, we watched them utilize the hyperlane network, and we are finally able to follow our Space Amoeba friends from their breeding grounds to the stars. But, where do they go? And, why?"
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_ELDEST_SIBLING:0 "We know that our species cultivated rich and advanced civilizations before ours, but the story of what happened to them is mostly myth and speculation.\n\nOne legend that has survived is the one of the §YStar Reachers§! - pioneers that somehow managed to leave the homeworld, and supposedly settled on nearby planets. A thrilling legend, no doubt. One which breathtaking scope and adventurous spirit is matched only by its glaring lack of evidence.\n\nWe are now in a time of interstellar flight. Technology allows us to leave the atmosphere of our homeworld to - perhaps once again - explore space. Let's see how well the old legend holds up."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_ENLIGHTENED:0 "More than a hundred years ago, when our first crude sublight probes visited the star systems neighboring our own, we were discovered by an alien civilization. With superior technology than our own, we feared the worst. Despite the radical differences in our physiology, it quickly became apparent that their intentions were not hostile. They spent generations teaching us, guiding us, and tranforming us into the society we have become today. Now, they have deemed that we are ready to explore the stars at their side!"
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_LIVING_PLANET:0 "When our collective consciousness awoke, our tendrils had already grown to span most of the planet. We first looked inward, to determine what we were. Then, we looked around, to understand our planet. We move as one. We think as one. We have devised new methods of travel, which will allow us to reach to stars. Now, we look outward, to the rest of the galaxy."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_LIVING_PLANET_DEVOURING_SWARM:0 "When our collective consciousness awoke, our yearning for flesh had already consumed all other life on the planet. We first looked inward, to determine what we were. Then, we looked around, to understand our planet. We move as one. We think as one. We have devised new methods of travel, which will allow us to reach to stars. Now, we look outward, to feed on the rest of the galaxy."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_OVERLORD:0 "Decades ago, when our first crude sublight probes visited the star systems neighboring our own, we discovered the presence of a distinct alien civilization. Like us, they were also on the cusp of unlocking practical interstellar travel.\n\nWe proved the stronger, however, and subjugated them in the name of the greater good."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_PRESENTIENT_COUSINS:0 "In the eons since the the primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape on [GetHomeWorldName], another species has lived among us. While not quite able to make the leap to sapience, somehow it was able to survive the most warlike parts of our past. Now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp! Perhaps, among the stars, we may find the technology necessary to help our wayward cousins rise up above their lot in life. Then again, perhaps not."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_ROGUE_PLANET:0 "Our oldest legends tell of how our planet was created to be the center of the universe. As our technology advanced, we became aware of luminous bodies called 'stars' that suffuse the infinite darkness. We have now devised new methods of travel, which will allow us to reach to these so-called stars. Now, we look outward, to the rest of the galaxy."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_SINS_OF_THE_PAST:0 "It has been several generations since the incident. During our exile on this orbital Habitat, we have had time to think, time to learn, and time to change. As our homeworld's climate begins to stabilize into something marginally habitable, our researchers have discovered the secret of the hyperdrive. For generations, we have looked within. Now that the galaxy is within our grasp, we can look without."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_TALE_OF_TWO_PLANETS:0 "We have wondered since time immemorial if we were alone in the universe. Throughout history, we have looked to the heavens... to the stars. Imagine our surprise when our earliest astronomers using the most rudimentary telescopes found a peculiar wanderer in our sky. Ever since then, our best scientists have put their minds toward advancing our space sciences."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_UNILATERAL_TRADE_AGREEMENT:0 "Decades ago, when our first crude sublight probes visited the star systems neighboring our own, we discovered the presence of a distinct alien civilization. Like us, they were also on the cusp of unlocking practical interstellar travel.\n\nWe proved the stronger, however, and subjugated them in the name of the greater good."
 START_SCREEN_ASO_EC_ORIGIN_VIOLENT_UPLIFT:0 "The aliens attacked us before we even knew about extraterrestrial life. They caught us unawares, but they did not catch us unprepared. We fought back, and we won. We lost so many of our own, but we gained some their technology. We fortified our own system while reverse engineering their hyperdrives. Now, we are ready to meet them on equal terms. And, we will prevail."

We have also found some instruments that we have not yet been able to determine their function. We must spend more time determining the purpose of this laboratory."
 aso_ec_origin_amoeba_alveo.9.desc:0 "Astounding news - it appears that we found out the function of this research facility. It appears they were trying to somehow modify the Space Amoeba species. More time is required to learn what, and why."
 aso_ec_origin_amoeba_alveo.10.desc:0 "We have concluded that the Space Amoebas were being modified in such a way to make them not only docile, but controllable. Apparently, a sort-of hyperspace laser pointer was going to be used to direct modified Space Amoebas to specific locations, presumably for the purposes of defense. Unfortunately, it looks like the lead scientist not only abandoned the project, but also fled with a key component. We are unsure what the component is, but we have pieced together enough clues to pinpoint the coordinates of his refuge."

 aso_ec_taleoftwoplanets.20.desc:0 "The first of our newly-commissioned vessels arrived at the planet, and found it... dominated by a presapient species. Though the planet supports a healthy and diverse ecosystem of wildlife, the dominant species can not yet be called intelligent life."

 aso_ec_taleoftwoplanets.51.desc:0 "After some time, they ended up making contact with us. Apparently, their discovery of our existence has frightened them into a war footing! They have mastered the atom, and, if provoked, enough of their rockets may make it through our defenses to stike our homeworld."
 aso_ec_taleoftwoplanets.51.a:0 "We cannot allow this!"
 aso_ec_taleoftwoplanets.51.a.tooltip:0 "They cannot be allowed to maintain a military capability to threaten us!"

After a brief series of escalations, they launched thousands of nuclear missiles at our homeworld. We got shot them all down, and began a long and bloody ground campaign. After many years of fighting, and many attempts at soliciting their surrender, we finally wiped them all out."
 aso_ec_taleoftwoplanets.5113.a:0 "We gave them a chance..."
